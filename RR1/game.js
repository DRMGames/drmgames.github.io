//Mod 1: Added Toy Story reference to status line.
//Mod 2: Changed grid size to 10x10.
//Mod 3: When a bead is hovered over, it turns gray and turns white again when exited.
//Mod 4: If a bead is clicked, it turns red, and an exclamation point appears inside of it. It stays like this when exited.
//Mod 5: If the grid is exited, the whole board fills with question marks. If the grid is reentered, all bead colors remain, but all of the glyphs are erased.
